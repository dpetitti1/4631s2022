The rest of the app is self-explanatory


My app was designed to create an area for roommates to come rogether in order to organize group needs in order to have sufficent living. I had trouble creating a chat so I just attached an image there - this is somethingI plan to work on when I take part 2 of this course. The app is supposed to have a social aspect to it as well, which I haven't been able to add in yet. This is what differentiates it from other typical roommate apps.
